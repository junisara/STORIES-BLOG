If you go up, the restaurant is bigger than you think.\n\n![Restaurant atmosphere](./images/njo2_20221217_185725-01.jpeg)\n\nThe restaurant is not a sophisticated interior. It's said to be a 40-year-old tradition, and it's a good atmosphere.\n\n![주방](./images/njo2_20221217_190010-01.jpeg)\n\nThe kitchen is an open kitchen inside.\n\n## Representative menu and price (cost-effectiveness)\n\nThere are a variety of menus, and the representative menus are **potato ongshimi**, **jangkalguksu**, and **potato pancake**.\n\n![Images/njo2_20221217_185656-01.jpeg)\n\n## Food I've tried\n\nWe ordered Jang Kalguksu and Potato Pancake.\n\n![Side dish mixed with radish salad](./images/njo2_20221217_185756-01.jpeg)\n\nWhen you order, you put the mixed gourd and radish salad in a jar. You can eat as much as you want on a plate. Mixed gourd and radish salad also taste good.\n\n![Potato pancake](./images/njo2_20221217_190219-01.jpeg)\n\nFirst, potato pancake It tasted good because it was crispy and had a unique texture of potato pancake. The representative menu is worth it.\n\n![Jang kalguksu](./images/njo2_20221217_190329-01.jpeg)\n\nFinally, the noodles are ready. The soup is made with soy sauce, so the thick and spicy taste is excellent. But it's not too spicy. Between red pepper paste and soybean paste...I think it's a taste of.\n\n![Details of long knife noodles](./images/njo2_20221217_190337-01.jpeg)\n\nSeaweed and sesame are served on top of kalguksu. It looked so delicious.\n\n![Long-knife noodle soup](./images/njo2_20221217_190409-01.jpeg)\n\nThe noodles are also thicker than regular kalguksu noodles. Noodles taste good, too.\n\n![Roll rice in soup](./images/njo2_20221217_191435-01.jpeg)\n\nIt doesn't look neat in the picture, but I'm really satisfied with the rice. If you don't like noodles, you should look forward to rice.\n\n## Taste Assessment (extremely subjective)\n\nI ate it satisfactorily. The spicy taste and thick soup are excellent so that it's not too spicy.\n\n<div class='alert alert-info'>\n<b>Subjective taste score: </b> ★★★★☆\n</div>\n\n## Restaurant Management System\n\nWe have general operations that are nothing special.\n\n<div class='alert alert-info'>\n<b>Operating System: </b> ★★★☆☆\n</div>\n\n## Cleanliness\n\nThe cleanliness is not too bad, but overall, it doesn't feel clean.\n\n<div class='alert alert-info'>\n<b>Cleanliness: </b> ★★☆☆☆\n</div>\n\n## Kindness\n\nIt was hard to feel that the owner was kind because the person who was serving was not Korean.

There is a waiting room, and the operating hours are short from 11 p.m. to 2 p.m., so you have to decide to go there. Young people in their 20s and 30s usually visit.\n\n![Restaurant building](./images/njo2_20221217_114242-01.jpeg)\n\nThe restaurant is a building on the main street. The name of the restaurant is neither more nor less **Chodang Jjolmyeon Soft Tofu**.\n\n![Waiting Method](./images/njo2_20221217_123454-01.jpeg)\n\nOnce you arrive at the restaurant, you have to order from the kiosk first. If you receive the order number and wait in the waiting area (the waiting room), call the number. It is not a system that notifies you by Kakao Talk or text message.\n\n![Order System](./images/njo2_20221217_123323-01.jpeg)\n\nOrder through kiosk as above. You can pay by credit card, or if it's cash, you can pay at the counter. You have to keep it well because there is a call number on the receipt.\n\n![Waiting place](./images/njo2_20221217_114310-01.jpeg)\n\nThere's a waiting room right next to it. Originally, it looks like an unmanned cafe, but it is used as a waiting place for soft tofu restaurants. The owner of this waiting room seems to be the owner of a soft tofu restaurant. If you're waiting here, they'll call your number.\n\n![Inside the waiting area](./images/njo2_20221217_114413-01.jpeg)\n\nThe interior of the waiting room has an old '60s and '70s atmosphere.\n\n![Soft Tofu and Rice](./images/njo2_20221217_121227-01.jpeg)\n\nWe waited in the waiting room for about 30 minutes, and our turn came. **The menu is Chodang Jjolmyeon soft tofu and sanjeok (beef) rice balls only 2**. We couldn't order because we ran out of rice balls. Instead, you can eat the rice with unlimited refills.\n\n![반찬](./images/njo2_20221217_121223-01.jpeg)\n\nThe side dishes are pickled radish and two bean sprouts. Side dishes are not the main dish, so it doesn't matter.\n\n![Soft Tofu](./images/njo2_20221217_121135-01.jpeg)\n\nThere is jjolmyeon on the floor and chili oil is floating on top. There are uncooked eggs on top. So when you get the soft tofu, you have to turn it upside down and mix it. That way, the eggs will be cooked and the jjolmyeon on the floor won't burn.\n\n![How to eat deliciously](./images/njo2_20221217_120948-01.jpeg)\n\n## Taste Assessment (extremely subjective)\n\nIt's delicious. It's usually a single menu, but if there are many people, it's likely to be a good restaurant.\n\n<div class='alert alert-info'>\n<b>Subjective taste score: </b> ★★★★☆\n</div>\n\n## Restaurant Management System\n\nFrom the order to the waiting, the food is served in a quick succession. Of course, there are many people waiting, but it was nice to be able to wait while running the waiting room. However, what's unfortunate is that it would be better to establish a system that informs you through Kakao Talk or text messages.\n\n<div class='alert alert-info'>\n<b>Operating System: </b> ★★★★☆\n</div>\n\n## Cleanliness\n\nIt's just the right amount of cleanliness.\n\n<div class='alert alert-info'>\n<b>Cleanliness: </b> ★★★★☆\n</div>\n\n## Restaurant and parking information\n\n- Address: 515-11th floor, Haean-ro, Donghae-si, Gangwon-do\n- Contact: 0507-1389-9639\n- Business hours: 11:00 to 14:30\n- Break time: None\n- Last order: 14:00\n- Closed: Every Tuesday\n- Parking: There is a parking lot in front of the restaurant, but parking is not easy because it is almost full.
