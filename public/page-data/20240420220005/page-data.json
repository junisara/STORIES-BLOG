I checked in at the accommodation and came out for dinner, but at around 6:30 p.m., most of the restaurants were closed, so I couldn't find the right restaurant. Maybe it's because it's in the countryside, but it seemed to close the restaurant very quickly. (I can't get used to it)\n\nI hurriedly searched for a good restaurant on Naver and found a place with a good rating and an open door, so I went there.\n\n# Chinese food, Man Gang Hong\n\n![건물](./images/njo2_20221216_184927-01.jpeg)\n\nIt's the Man Gang Hong building. The first floor looks like a restaurant, but the first floor is not a restaurant, but you have to go up to the second floor using the stairs to the right of the building to get to the restaurant.\n\n![Entrance view](./images/njo2_20221216_191933-01.jpeg)\n\nIf you go up to the second floor, there is a red light in front of you that smells like China.\n\n![입구](./images/njo2_20221216_191930-01.jpeg)\n\nIf you go up to the second floor, there is an entrance on your left. Seeing that there is a waiting board, I guess this restaurant also has a waiting room. We arrived around 6:50 p.m. and we were able to get a seat right away without waiting, perhaps because it was a weekday.\n\n## Representative menu and price (cost-effectiveness)\n\n![메뉴](./images/njo2_20221216_185216-01.jpeg)\n\nI looked it up and found that the representative menus here are **Lemon Sweet and Sour Pork and **Fried Spicy Seafood Noodles. There is a set menu for two people, and although the amount of each food is a little small, it was good to eat two foods and sweet and sour pork.\n\n## Food I've tried\n\nWe ordered 2 servings of lemon tangsuyuk + stir-fried jjamppong for 2 servings.\n\n![반찬](./images/njo2_20221216_185425-01.jpeg)\n\nAs with Chinese food, onions, pickled radish, chunjang, and soy sauce were served. The soy sauce is probably for dipping sweet and sour pork.\n\n![Sweet and Sour Pork](./images/njo2_20221216_185545-01.jpeg)\n\nIt's sweet and sour pork. Maybe it's because of lemon, but it has a unique scent. It didn't smell good to me, but it tasted good when I tried sweet and sour pork. The plating was good because it came out sprinkled with cabbage and sprout almond slices.\n\n![Stir-fried Spicy Seafood Noodles](./images/njo2_20221216_185740-01.jpeg)\n\nI liked stir-fried jjamppong because it was moderately small. I liked the taste, but my wife said it was a bit salty.\n\n## Taste Assessment (extremely subjective)\n\nIt's just the right amount and the right taste. I personally liked the taste of stir-fried jjamppong.\n\n<div class='alert alert-info'>\n<b>Subjective taste score: </b> ★★★☆☆\n</div>\n\nRather than recommending it, it's not a bad restaurant to eat a meal.\n\n## Restaurant and parking information\n\n- Address: 202nd floor, Pyeongwon-ro, Donghae-si, Gangwon-do\n- Contact number: 033-532-5644\n- Business hours: 11:00 - 21:00\n  - Break time: 15:00 - 17:00\n  - Last order: 20:00\n- Closed: Every Sunday\n- Parking: There is no separate parking lot.

Dongdong Noodles is a famous restaurant for **Yukgaejang+Kalguksu**, and it is said that Gonjiam is **the main store**. (But it's a little strange that this place is **Original Choi Mi-jja-meori gukbap** on Naver Map.)\n\n![Excerpt from Naver Map](images/2022-12-20-19-11-30.png)\n\n## Representative menu and price (cost-effectiveness)\n\n![메뉴](./images/njo2_20221215_163952-01.jpeg)\n\nDongdong Noodles' main menu is **Yukkal**, which consists of Yukgaejang + Kalguksu + Rice.\n\n## Food I've tried\n\nWe ordered **Yuk-Kal, beef meat pancake, dumplings (meat, kimchi)**.\n\n![Side dish](./images/njo2_20221215_163942-01.jpeg)\n\nIf you order, you will get kimchi, kkakdugi, radish kimchi. The side dishes are generally neat and taste good. It says that you make kimchi yourself, but it tastes really good.\n\n![](./images/njo2_20221215_164458-01.jpeg)\n\nFinally, we have a Yuk-Kal. It is a combination of boiled noodles and rice with Yukgaejang and Kalguksu.\n\n![](./images/njo2_20221215_164538-01.jpeg)\n\nThe torn meat looks delicious The soup is also spicy and delicious.\n\n![](./images/njo2_20221215_164612-01.jpeg)\n\nFirst, I put kalguksu in Yukgaejang and roll it and eat it. You can put rice in it after eating.\n\n![](./images/njo2_20221215_164520-01.jpeg)\n\nAnother delicacy is this meat pancake. I just ordered it without thinking and it's delicious. I ordered half a plate, but I should have just ordered a plate of meat pancake without dumplings That's what I think.\n\n![](./images/njo2_20221215_164643-01.jpeg)\n\nDumplings can be ordered at **1,000 won per unit** for easy ordering, so it was good that you could only order as much as you want. However, the dumpling is not a hand dumpling, but a supermarket dumpling, so it doesn't taste very distinctive.\n\n## Taste Assessment (extremely subjective)\n\nYuk-Kal and meat pancake tasted good. It's worth recommended.\nHowever, I don't think you need to buy dumplings here.\n\n<div class='alert alert-info'>\n<b>Subjective taste score: </b> ★★★★☆\n</div>\n\n## Restaurant Management System\n\nIt was simple but helpful because I put the way to eat yukkal deliciously on every table.\n\n![](./images/njo2_20221215_164059-01.jpeg)\n\nAnd it's possible to wrap it, and if you wrap it, it gives you a lot. Haha\n\n![](./images/njo2_20221215_164035-01.jpeg)\n\nAt first, you can bring side dishes and eat additional side dishes or rice at the self-corner.\n\n<div class='alert alert-info'>\n<b>Operating System: </b> ★★★★☆\n</div>\n\n## Cleanliness\n\n![](./images/njo2_20221215_164010-01.jpeg)\n\nThe cleanliness of the restaurant also looks good.

So, the place that became famous was Sogili, and among them, the place where we often eat **Seohwang Donkatsu** became famous, too.\n\n![Seohwang Pork Cutlet](./images/njo2_20220916_180554-01.jpeg)\n\nThe restaurant is next to the one-lane road passing through the village. At first, I thought Yoyuna Cafe was Seohwang Pork Cutlet, so I wandered around and found Seohwang Pork Cutlet a little further in front.\n\n![Menu](./images/njo2_20220916_173150-01.jpeg)\n\nI arrived around 5:10 p.m. before dinner started, but it was break time, so I waited in the car for a while and **entered at 5:30 p.m.** Maybe because dinner started, I entered without waiting, and not many people came during the meal. But there was no empty table.\n\n## Representative menu and price (cost-effectiveness)\n\nThe food we ordered is **modum katsu** and **salad udon**. Donkatsu is basically used for black pork, and the price is basically high because it is based on Jeju fish that is brought in from time to time.\n\n## Food I've tried\n\nWe ordered assorted katsu and salad udon.\n\n![Modumkatsu](./images/njo2_20220916_174159-01.jpeg)\n\n\\*\\*Modum katsu comes with fried black pork tenderloin, fish, and shrimp. The basic sauce for tonkatsu and tartar sauce for fishkatsu are served. It comes with miso bean paste soup, rice, pickled radish, and kimchi.  \nI heard that fried rubber shoes are delicious. Assorted katsu has a really good texture and taste.\n\n![Salad udon](./images/njo2_20220916_174540-01.jpeg)\n\nThe second food is salad udon. It's a cold food and I thought it would taste like that for me, who likes meat, but the amount is bigger than I thought and the taste is good. It's a recommended food.\n\n## Taste Assessment (extremely subjective)\n\nOverall, the taste is worth reducing the passing score. However, it is not a cost-effective food because it is a bit expensive. It is an understandable price in that it uses black pork and fish on the same day.\n\n<div class='alert alert-info'>\n<b>Subjective taste score: </b> ★★★★☆\n</div>\n\n## Cleanliness\n\nThe basic of Japanese food is cleanliness, so it is clean on the outside.\n\n<div class='alert alert-info'>\n<b>Cleanliness: </b> ★★★★☆\n</div>\n\n## Restaurant and parking information\n\n- Address: Seohwang on the first floor of 205-21, Aewol-eup, Jeju-si\n- Contact: 064-799-5458\n- Business hours (break time): 11:30-20:00 (15:00-17:30 break time)\n- Closed: Closed every Monday and Tuesday\n- Parking: There is no dedicated parking lot, but you can park in the vacant lot on the right diagonally across the street.\n\n<div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'>\n<iframe src='https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d832.3947396708337!2d126.37874023469442!3d33.43421979628319!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x350cf65afefbdd15%3A0xd71ff48f964a05e9!2zVE9OS0FUU1Ug7ISc7Zmp!5e0!3m2!1sko!2skr!4v1670310078410!5m2!1sko!2skr' class='embed-responsive-item' allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Seohwang Pork Cutlet in Sogili, which Lee Hyo-ri often visits.","postId":"20240420220008","datePublished":"2024-04-20T18:06:17+09:00","dateUpdated":"2024-05-08T10:20:45+09:00","desc":null,"taxonomy":{"tag":["Korea","a trip to Korea","Korean restaurants","a good restaurant","Jeju Island","Famous restaurants in Jeju","Lee Hyori","Western yellow"]},"thumbnail":null,"publish":"published"},"fields":{"currentCategory":"02.맛집이야기","readingMinutes":3},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/Volumes/DATA 1/002.POSTS/STORIES/BLOG/_POSTS/02.맛집이야기/20220916_[제주 맛집] 이효리가 자주 찾는 소길리 서황 돈까스 맛집/[20240420220008]_item.en.md"}}},"pageContext":{"postId":"20240420220005","nextId":"866a8d9f-dd46-5170-bc78-568ddb69e34f","previousId":"64f21e09-e1f8-53e9-8e01-04fd301aabbf","frontmatter":{"title":"DONGHAE's Chinese restaurant Man Gang Hong, which is open until dinner.","publish":"published","blogs":{"tistory":{"regist":false,"name":"stories"},"blogger":{"regist":true,"name":"5255262541558351240"}},"taxonomy":{"category":"Stories of good restaurants","tag":["Korea","a trip to Korea","Korean restaurants","a good restaurant","Good restaurant in Donghae","Chinese food","full red"]},"tistory":"","blogger":{"driveFolderId":"1nWpNnwifh92vGkQbhF9FHLMx1hlOpmXx","postId":"8868966338978950174","url":"http://junistory.blogspot.com/2022/12/donghaes-chinese-restaurant-man-gang.html","published":"2022. 12. 25. 오후 9:56:41","updated":"2022. 12. 25. 오후 9:56:41"},"datePublished":"2024-04-20T18:06:17+09:00","dateUpdated":"2024-05-08T10:20:46+09:00","postId":"20240420220005"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2272033271","2447914076","4101274445"],"slicesMap":{}}
