So, the place that became famous was Sogili, and among them, the place where we often eat **Seohwang Donkatsu** became famous, too.\n\n![Seohwang Pork Cutlet](./images/njo2_20220916_180554-01.jpeg)\n\nThe restaurant is next to the one-lane road passing through the village. At first, I thought Yoyuna Cafe was Seohwang Pork Cutlet, so I wandered around and found Seohwang Pork Cutlet a little further in front.\n\n![Menu](./images/njo2_20220916_173150-01.jpeg)\n\nI arrived around 5:10 p.m. before dinner started, but it was break time, so I waited in the car for a while and **entered at 5:30 p.m.** Maybe because dinner started, I entered without waiting, and not many people came during the meal. But there was no empty table.\n\n## Representative menu and price (cost-effectiveness)\n\nThe food we ordered is **modum katsu** and **salad udon**. Donkatsu is basically used for black pork, and the price is basically high because it is based on Jeju fish that is brought in from time to time.\n\n## Food I've tried\n\nWe ordered assorted katsu and salad udon.\n\n![Modumkatsu](./images/njo2_20220916_174159-01.jpeg)\n\n\\*\\*Modum katsu comes with fried black pork tenderloin, fish, and shrimp. The basic sauce for tonkatsu and tartar sauce for fishkatsu are served. It comes with miso bean paste soup, rice, pickled radish, and kimchi.  \nI heard that fried rubber shoes are delicious. Assorted katsu has a really good texture and taste.\n\n![Salad udon](./images/njo2_20220916_174540-01.jpeg)\n\nThe second food is salad udon. It's a cold food and I thought it would taste like that for me, who likes meat, but the amount is bigger than I thought and the taste is good. It's a recommended food.\n\n## Taste Assessment (extremely subjective)\n\nOverall, the taste is worth reducing the passing score. However, it is not a cost-effective food because it is a bit expensive. It is an understandable price in that it uses black pork and fish on the same day.\n\n<div class='alert alert-info'>\n<b>Subjective taste score: </b> ★★★★☆\n</div>\n\n## Cleanliness\n\nThe basic of Japanese food is cleanliness, so it is clean on the outside.\n\n<div class='alert alert-info'>\n<b>Cleanliness: </b> ★★★★☆\n</div>\n\n## Restaurant and parking information\n\n- Address: Seohwang on the first floor of 205-21, Aewol-eup, Jeju-si\n- Contact: 064-799-5458\n- Business hours (break time): 11:30-20:00 (15:00-17:30 break time)\n- Closed: Closed every Monday and Tuesday\n- Parking: There is no dedicated parking lot, but you can park in the vacant lot on the right diagonally across the street.\n\n<div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'>\n<iframe src='https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d832.3947396708337!2d126.37874023469442!3d33.43421979628319!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x350cf65afefbdd15%3A0xd71ff48f964a05e9!2zVE9OS0FUU1Ug7ISc7Zmp!5e0!3m2!1sko!2skr!4v1670310078410!5m2!1sko!2skr' class='embed-responsive-item' allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Seohwang Pork Cutlet in Sogili, which Lee Hyo-ri often visits.","postId":"20240420220008","datePublished":"2024-04-20T18:06:17+09:00","dateUpdated":"2024-05-08T10:20:45+09:00","desc":null,"taxonomy":{"tag":["Korea","a trip to Korea","Korean restaurants","a good restaurant","Jeju Island","Famous restaurants in Jeju","Lee Hyori","Western yellow"]},"thumbnail":null,"publish":"published"},"fields":{"currentCategory":"02.맛집이야기","readingMinutes":3},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/Volumes/DATA 1/002.POSTS/STORIES/BLOG/_POSTS/02.맛집이야기/20220916_[제주 맛집] 이효리가 자주 찾는 소길리 서황 돈까스 맛집/[20240420220008]_item.en.md"}},"previous":{"body":"\nAfter looking around the Sogeumsan Grand Valley in Wonju, we took Yeongdong Expressway and moved to the East Sea, which is a little far away. I checked in at the accommodation and came out for dinner, but at around 6:30 p.m., most of the restaurants were closed, so I couldn't find the right restaurant. Maybe it's because it's in the countryside, but it seemed to close the restaurant very quickly. (I can't get used to it)\n\nI hurriedly searched for a good restaurant on Naver and found a place with a good rating and an open door, so I went there.\n\n# Chinese food, Man Gang Hong\n\n![건물](./images/njo2_20221216_184927-01.jpeg)\n\nIt's the Man Gang Hong building. The first floor looks like a restaurant, but the first floor is not a restaurant, but you have to go up to the second floor using the stairs to the right of the building to get to the restaurant.\n\n![Entrance view](./images/njo2_20221216_191933-01.jpeg)\n\nIf you go up to the second floor, there is a red light in front of you that smells like China.\n\n![입구](./images/njo2_20221216_191930-01.jpeg)\n\nIf you go up to the second floor, there is an entrance on your left. Seeing that there is a waiting board, I guess this restaurant also has a waiting room. We arrived around 6:50 p.m. and we were able to get a seat right away without waiting, perhaps because it was a weekday.\n\n## Representative menu and price (cost-effectiveness)\n\n![메뉴](./images/njo2_20221216_185216-01.jpeg)\n\nI looked it up and found that the representative menus here are **Lemon Sweet and Sour Pork and **Fried Spicy Seafood Noodles. There is a set menu for two people, and although the amount of each food is a little small, it was good to eat two foods and sweet and sour pork.\n\n## Food I've tried\n\nWe ordered 2 servings of lemon tangsuyuk + stir-fried jjamppong for 2 servings.\n\n![반찬](./images/njo2_20221216_185425-01.jpeg)\n\nAs with Chinese food, onions, pickled radish, chunjang, and soy sauce were served. The soy sauce is probably for dipping sweet and sour pork.\n\n![Sweet and Sour Pork](./images/njo2_20221216_185545-01.jpeg)\n\nIt's sweet and sour pork. Maybe it's because of lemon, but it has a unique scent. It didn't smell good to me, but it tasted good when I tried sweet and sour pork. The plating was good because it came out sprinkled with cabbage and sprout almond slices.\n\n![Stir-fried Spicy Seafood Noodles](./images/njo2_20221216_185740-01.jpeg)\n\nI liked stir-fried jjamppong because it was moderately small. I liked the taste, but my wife said it was a bit salty.\n\n## Taste Assessment (extremely subjective)\n\nIt's just the right amount and the right taste. I personally liked the taste of stir-fried jjamppong.\n\n<div class='alert alert-info'>\n<b>Subjective taste score: </b> ★★★☆☆\n</div>\n\nRather than recommending it, it's not a bad restaurant to eat a meal.\n\n## Restaurant and parking information\n\n- Address: 202nd floor, Pyeongwon-ro, Donghae-si, Gangwon-do\n- Contact number: 033-532-5644\n- Business hours: 11:00 - 21:00\n  - Break time: 15:00 - 17:00\n  - Last order: 20:00\n- Closed: Every Sunday\n- Parking: There is no separate parking lot. You should use the parking lot of the art center in the alley or in the front.\n\n<div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'>\n<iframe src='https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2660.8254884599!2d129.11384489599763!3d37.52507079978417!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x3561c7823ea3d385%3A0x628618429dd152cb!2z66eM6rCV7ZmN!5e0!3m2!1sko!2skr!4v1671703420038!5m2!1sko!2skr' class='embed-responsive-item' allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"DONGHAE's Chinese restaurant Man Gang Hong, which is open until dinner.","postId":"20240420220005","datePublished":"2024-04-20T18:06:17+09:00","dateUpdated":"2024-05-08T10:20:46+09:00","desc":null,"taxonomy":{"tag":["Korea","a trip to Korea","Korean restaurants","a good restaurant","Good restaurant in Donghae","Chinese food","full red"]},"thumbnail":null,"publish":"published"},"fields":{"currentCategory":"02.맛집이야기","readingMinutes":3},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/Volumes/DATA 1/002.POSTS/STORIES/BLOG/_POSTS/02.맛집이야기/20221222_[동해 맛집]_중식 맛집 만강홍/[20240420220005]_item.en.md"}},"next":{"body":"\n\n\n이효리가 애월의 소길리에 살면서 얻은 별명 가운데 하나가 소길댁 이였죠. 그래서 유명해진 곳이 소길리이고 그중에서도 식사를 자주 하는 곳인 **서황 돈카츠**도 같이 유명세를 치르게 되었습니다.\n\n![서황 돈까스](./images/njo2_20220916_180554-01.jpeg)\n\n식당은 마을을 지나가는 1차선 도로 옆에 있습니다. 처음엔 요유나 카페가 서황 돈카츠인 줄 알고 서성이다가 조금 더 앞쪽에 있는 서황 돈까스를 찾게 되었습니다.\n\n![메뉴판](./images/njo2_20220916_173150-01.jpeg)\n\n아직 저녁 식사가 시작되기 전인 오후 5시 10분 정도에 도착을 했는데 브레이크 타임이라 차에서 잠시 기다렸다가 **5시 30분에 입장**을 하게 되었습니다. 저녁식사가 시작되는 시간이라 그런지 웨이팅 없이 입장을 했고 식사하는 중에도 그렇게 많은 사람들이 오지는 않았습니다. 그래도 빈 테이블은 없었습니다. 제주도의 여느 맛집에 비하면 웨이팅이 심하지는 않은것 같습니다.\n\n## 대표 메뉴와 가격(가성비)\n\n저희가 주문한 음식은 **모듬카츠**와 **샐러드 우동**입니다. 돈카츠는 모두 흑돼지를 기본으로 사용하고 있고 생선도 그때그때 들여오는 제주산 생선을 기본으로 하기 때문에 기본적으로 가격은 높은 편입니다.\n\n## 먹어본 음식\n\n저희는 모듬카츠와 샐러드 우동을 주문했습니다.\n\n![모듬카츠](./images/njo2_20220916_174159-01.jpeg)\n\n**모듬카츠는 흑돼지 안심, 생선, 새우**를 재료로 튀긴 음식이 나옵니다. 기본 돈카츠용 소스와 생선카츠용 타르타르 소스가 나옵니다. 미소된장국과 밥, 그리고 단무지와 김치가 곁들여 나옵니다.  \n고무신도 튀기면 맛있다고 하던데.. 모듬카츠도 정말 식감도 좋고 맛도 좋습니다.\n\n![샐러드 우동](./images/njo2_20220916_174540-01.jpeg)\n\n두 번째 음식은 샐러드 우동입니다. 차갑게 먹는 음식이고 고기파인 저에게는 좀 그저 그런 맛일 거라 생각했는데, 생각보다 양도 많고 맛도 좋습니다. 추천할 만한 음식입니다.\n\n## 맛 평가 (지극히 주관적임)\n\n전반적으로 맛은 합격점을 줄만합니다. 다만 가격이 다소 비싸서 가성비 음식은 아닙니다. 흑돼지와 당일 생선을 사용한다는 점에서 이해할 만한 수준의 가격이긴 합니다.\n\n<div class='alert alert-info'>\n<b>주관적인 맛 점수 : </b> ★★★★☆\n</div>\n\n## 청결도\n\n일식의 기본은 청결이기 때문에 겉으로 봐선 깨끗한 수준입니다.\n\n<div class='alert alert-info'>\n<b>청결도 : </b> ★★★★☆\n</div>\n\n## 식당과 주차 정보\n\n- 주소 : 제주 제주시 애월읍 장소로 205-2 1층 서황\n- 연락처 : 064-799-5458\n- 영업시간(브레이크 타임) : 11:30 - 20:00 (15:00 - 17:30 브레이크 타임)\n- 휴무일 : 매주 월, 화 정기휴무\n- 주차 : 전용 주차장은 없고 길 건너 대각선 오른쪽에 있는 공터에 주차를 하면 됩니다.\n\n<div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'>\n<iframe src='https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d832.3947396708337!2d126.37874023469442!3d33.43421979628319!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x350cf65afefbdd15%3A0xd71ff48f964a05e9!2zVE9OS0FUU1Ug7ISc7Zmp!5e0!3m2!1sko!2skr!4v1670310078410!5m2!1sko!2skr' class='embed-responsive-item' allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"[제주 맛집] 이효리가 자주 찾는 소길리 서황 돈까스","postId":"601","datePublished":"2024-04-20T18:06:17+09:00","dateUpdated":"2024-05-08T10:20:45+09:00","desc":null,"taxonomy":{"tag":["한국","한국여행","한국맛집","맛집","제주","제주맛집","이효리","소길댁","서황","서황돈까스"]},"thumbnail":null,"publish":"published"},"fields":{"currentCategory":"02.맛집이야기","readingMinutes":5},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/Volumes/DATA 1/002.POSTS/STORIES/BLOG/_POSTS/02.맛집이야기/20220916_[제주 맛집] 이효리가 자주 찾는 소길리 서황 돈까스 맛집/[601]_item.md"}}},"pageContext":{"postId":"20240420220008","nextId":"33db98fc-092b-5fa5-8ff4-846474eba688","previousId":"0434f3b5-8136-5a0e-8c35-036337bbd012","frontmatter":{"title":"Seohwang Pork Cutlet in Sogili, which Lee Hyo-ri often visits.","publish":"published","blogs":{"tistory":{"regist":false,"name":"stories"},"blogger":{"regist":true,"name":"5255262541558351240"}},"taxonomy":{"category":"Stories of good restaurants","tag":["Korea","a trip to Korea","Korean restaurants","a good restaurant","Jeju Island","Famous restaurants in Jeju","Lee Hyori","Western yellow"]},"tistory":"","blogger":{"driveFolderId":"1vW5LTf-M8mru81X9C7x3-PiBtHAiF30X","postId":"2781161322645450662","url":"http://junistory.blogspot.com/2022/12/seohwang-pork-cutlet-in-sogili-which.html","published":"2022. 12. 6. 오후 6:19:33","updated":"2022. 12. 6. 오후 6:19:56"},"datePublished":"2024-04-20T18:06:17+09:00","dateUpdated":"2024-05-08T10:20:45+09:00","postId":"20240420220008"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2272033271","2447914076","4101274445"],"slicesMap":{}}
